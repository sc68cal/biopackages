NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication - Infrastructure plugin for the
    Catalyst authentication framework.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authentication::Store::Foo
            Authentication::Credential::Password
        /;

        # later on ...
        # ->login is provided by the Credential::Password module
        $c->login('myusername', 'mypassword');
        my $age = $c->user->age;
        $c->logout;

DESCRIPTION
    The authentication plugin provides generic user support. It is the basis
    for both authentication (checking the user is who they claim to be), and
    authorization (allowing the user to do what the system authorises them
    to do).

    Using authentication is split into two parts. A Store is used to
    actually store the user information, and can store any amount of data
    related to the user. Multiple stores can be accessed from within one
    application. Credentials are used to verify users, using the store,
    given data from the frontend.

    To implement authentication in a Catalyst application you need to add
    this module, plus at least one store and one credential module.

    Authentication data can also be stored in a session, if the application
    is using the Catalyst::Plugin::Session module.

INTRODUCTION
  The Authentication/Authorization Process
    Web applications typically need to identify a user - to tell the user
    apart from other users. This is usually done in order to display private
    information that is only that user's business, or to limit access to the
    application so that only certain entities can access certain parts.

    This process is split up into several steps. First you ask the user to
    identify themselves. At this point you can't be sure that the user is
    really who they claim to be.

    Then the user tells you who they are, and backs this claim with some
    piece of information that only the real user could give you. For
    example, a password is a secret that is known to both the user and you.
    When the user tells you this password you can assume they're in on the
    secret and can be trusted (ignore identity theft for now). Checking the
    password, or any other proof is called credential verification.

    By this time you know exactly who the user is - the user's identity is
    authenticated. This is where this module's job stops, and other plugins
    step in. The next logical step is authorization, the process of deciding
    what a user is (or isn't) allowed to do. For example, say your users are
    split into two main groups - regular users and administrators. You
    should verify that the currently logged in user is indeed an
    administrator before performing the actions of an administrative part of
    your application. One way to do this is with role based access control.

  The Components In This Framework
   Credential Verifiers
    When user input is transferred to the Catalyst application (typically
    via form inputs) this data then enters the authentication framework
    through these plugins.

    These plugins check the data, and ensure that it really proves the user
    is who they claim to be.

   Storage Backends
    The credentials also identify a user, and this family of modules is
    supposed to take this identification data and return a standardized
    object oriented representation of users.

    When a user is retrieved from a store it is not necessarily
    authenticated. Credential verifiers can either accept a user object, or
    fetch the object themselves from the default store.

   The Core Plugin
    This plugin on its own is the glue, providing store registration,
    session integration, and other goodness for the other plugins.

   Other Plugins
    More layers of plugins can be stacked on top of the authentication code.
    For example, Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser provides an abstraction
    of browser sessions that is more persistent per users.
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles provides an accepted way to
    separate and group users into categories, and then check which
    categories the current user belongs to.

EXAMPLE
    Let's say we were storing users in an Apache style htpasswd file. Users
    are stored in that file, with a hashed password and some extra comments.
    Users are verified by supplying a password which is matched with the
    file.

    This means that our application will begin like this:

        package MyApp;

        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authentication::Credential::Password
            Authentication::Store::Htpasswd
        /;

        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{htpasswd} = "passwdfile";

    This loads the appropriate methods and also sets the htpasswd store as
    the default store.

    So, now that we have the code loaded we need to get data from the user
    into the credential verifier.

    Let's create an authentication controller:

        package MyApp::Controller::Auth;

        sub login : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            if (    my $user = $c->req->param("user")
                and my $password = $c->req->param("password") )
            {
                if ( $c->login( $user, $password ) ) {
                    $c->res->body( "hello " . $c->user->name );
                } else {
                    # login incorrect
                }
            }
            else {
                # invalid form input
            }
        }

    This code should be very readable. If all the necessary fields are
    supplied, call the "login" in Authentication::Credential::Password
    method on the controller. If that succeeds the user is logged in.

    It could be simplified though:

        sub login : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            if ( $c->login ) {
                ...
            }
        }

    Since the "login" method knows how to find logically named parameters on
    it's own.

    The credential verifier will ask the default store to get the user whose
    ID is the user parameter. In this case the default store is the htpasswd
    one. Once it fetches the user from the store the password is checked and
    if it's OK "$c->user" will contain the user object returned from the
    htpasswd store.

    We can also pass a user object to the credential verifier manually, if
    we have several stores per app. This is discussed in
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store.

    Now imagine each admin user has a comment set in the htpasswd file
    saying "admin".

    A restricted action might look like this:

        sub restricted : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->detach("unauthorized")
              unless $c->user_exists
              and $c->user->extra_info() eq "admin";

            # do something restricted here
        }

    This is somewhat similar to role based access control.
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Htpasswd treats the extra info
    field as a comma separated list of roles if it's treated that way. Let's
    leverage this. Add the role authorization plugin:

        use Catalyst qw/
            ...
            Authorization::Roles
        /;

        sub restricted : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->detach("unauthorized") unless $c->check_roles("admin");

            # do something restricted here
        }

    This is somewhat simpler and will work if you change your store, too,
    since the role interface is consistent.

    Let's say your app grew, and you now have 10000 users. It's no longer
    efficient to maintain an htpasswd file, so you move this data to a
    database.

        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authentication::Credential::Password
            Authentication::Store::DBIC
            Authorization::Roles
        /;

        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}{dbic} = ...; # see the DBIC store docs

    The rest of your code should be unchanged. Now let's say you are
    integrating typekey authentication to your system. For simplicity's sake
    we'll assume that the user's are still keyed in the same way.

        use Catalyst qw/
            Authentication
            Authentication::Credential::Password
            Authentication::Credential::TypeKey
            Authentication::Store::DBIC
            Authorization::Roles
        /;

    And in your auth controller add a new action:

        sub typekey : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            if ( $c->authenticate_typekey) { # uses $c->req and Authen::TypeKey
                # same stuff as the $c->login method
                # ...
            }
        }

    You've now added a new credential verification mechanizm orthogonally to
    the other components. All you have to do is make sure that the
    credential verifiers pass on the same types of parameters to the store
    in order to retrieve user objects.

METHODS
    user
        Returns the currently logged in user or undef if there is none.

    user_exists
        Whether or not a user is logged in right now.

        The reason this method exists is that "$c->user" may needlessly load
        the user from the auth store.

        If you're just going to say

                if ( $c->user_exists ) {
                        # foo
                } else {
                        $c->forward("login");
                }

        it should be more efficient than "$c->user" when a user is marked in
        the session but "$c->user" hasn't been called yet.

    logout
        Delete the currently logged in user from "user" and the session.

    get_user $uid
        Fetch a particular users details, defined by the given ID, via the
        default store.

CONFIGURATION
    use_session
        Whether or not to store the user's logged in state in the session,
        if the application is also using the Catalyst::Plugin::Session
        plugin. This value is set to true per default.

    store
        If multiple stores are being used, set the module you want as
        default here.

    stores
        If multiple stores are being used, you need to provide a name for
        each store here, as a hash, the keys are the names you wish to use,
        and the values are the the names of the plugins.

         # example
         __PACKAGE__->config( authentication => {
                                store => 'Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::HtPasswd',
                                stores => { 
                                   'dbic' => 'Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC'
                                          }
                                                 });

METHODS FOR STORE MANAGEMENT
    default_auth_store
        Return the store whose name is 'default'.

        This is set to "$c->config->{authentication}{store}" if that value
        exists, or by using a Store plugin:

                use Catalyst qw/Authentication Authentication::Store::Minimal/;

        Sets the default store to
        Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Minimal::Backend.

    get_auth_store $name
        Return the store whose name is $name.

    get_auth_store_name $store
        Return the name of the store $store.

    auth_stores
        A hash keyed by name, with the stores registered in the app.

    auth_store_names
        A ref-hash keyed by store, which contains the names of the stores.

    register_auth_stores %stores_by_name
        Register stores into the application.

INTERNAL METHODS
    set_authenticated $user
        Marks a user as authenticated. Should be called from a
        "Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential" plugin after
        successful authentication.

        This involves setting "user" and the internal data in "session" if
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session is loaded.

    auth_restore_user $user
        Used to restore a user from the session, by "user" only when it's
        actually needed.

    save_user_in_session $user
        Used to save the user in a session.

    prepare
        Revives a user from the session object if there is one.

    setup
        Sets the default configuration parameters.

Revision 1.3  2006/07/15 01:55:21  boconnor
I updated the hardcoded /usr directory in all the spec files.  This was to support MacOS which installs all RPMs into /usr/local.  It uses a RPM macro now to make it platform neutral.  I've also updated some other SPEC files to support MacOS, I've done my best to ensure any changes don't affect other platforms negatively
